### About Me
Hello visitor!  Let me take this time to tell you about myself.  I live in Allendale, NJ, and I'm a husband and father of three.  Up until recently, I have spent most of my time earning my Master's of Science Degree in Data Science from CUNY (link).  However, I was still able to keep a few hobbies, such as training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and watching hockey (I love to keep up with the advanced statistics).

I grew up in Pueblo, CO where I was very active in sports and ended up being a state runner-up (Junior year) and state champion (Senior year) in wrestling.  These achievements, along with my grades, made it possible for me to attend Columbia University, which was a great opportunity even though it was quite a distance away from my home at the time.  I met my wife in college and ultimately ended up staying in the New York City area to build our lives together.  

I did not start out as a data scientist.  I earned my Bachelor's of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering which lead to me becoming a building energy modeler and HVAC Designer at a MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) consulting firm where I eventuall earned my professional engineering license (PE).  During my time there, I taught myself how to program in VBA and Python as well as learn a monumental amount about what I was actually interested in doing.  As my career progressed, I realized just how much more I could do by using available data, and programming best practices, to become a better engineer.  I eventually changed jobs to work for a green building certification company (GBCI - link).  I found myself, again, writing programs and collecting data for various tasks asked of me.  By then it was very clear what was happening.  I was trying to solve my day to day work with analytical and programmatic solutions. The decision to enroll and earn my Master's degree in Data Science came pretty easy at that point.  I've learned a lot along the way, but most importantly, the biggest lesson was recognizing that the path to this point in time has solidified my confidence in career choice.

....and that brings us to present day.  I have put together some links, as well as explanations, of my work to-date in order to showcase what I can do.  Note, some of these examples were completed fairly early in my studies or were not final projects so they may be somewhat underdeveloped, but I thought it would be useful to show more, rather than less.
