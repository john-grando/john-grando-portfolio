### About Me
Hello visitor!  Let me take this time to tell you about myself.  I live in Allendale, NJ; I'm a husband and father of three.  Up until recently, I have spent most of my time earning my Master's of Science Degree in Data Science from CUNY (link).  However, I was still able to keep a few hobbies, such as training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and watching hockey (I love to keep up with the advanced statistics in this sport).

I grew up in Pueblo, CO where I was very active in sports and ended up being a state runner-up (Junior year) and state champion (Senior year) in wrestling.  These achievements, along with my grades, made it possible for me to attend Columbia University, which was a great opportunity even though it was quite a distance away from my home.  I met my wife in college and ultimately ended up staying in the New York City area to build our lives together.  

I did not start out as a data scientist.  I earned my Bachelor's of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering which lead to me becoming a building energy modeled and HVAC Designer at a MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) consulting firm.  During my time there, I taught myself how to program in VBA and Python as well as learn a monumental amount about what I was actually interested in doing.  During my time there, I realized just how much more I could do by using available data, and programming best practices, to become a better engineer.  I eventually changed jobs to work for a green building certification company (GBCI - link).  I found myself, again, writing programs and collecting data for various tasks asked of me.  By then it was very clear what I wanted to do and finally made a choice to earn my Master's degree in Data Science.  I feel that I've learned a lot along the way, but most importantly, the path to this point in time has solidified my confidence in career choice.

....and that brings us to present day.  I have put together some links, as well as explanations, of my work to-date to showcase what I can do.  Note, some of this was completed fairly early in my studies so it may be somewhat underdeveloped, but I thought it would be useful to show more, rather than less.
