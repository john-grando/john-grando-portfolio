### About Me
Hello visitor!  Let me take this time to tell you about myself.  I live in Allendale, NJ with my wife and three children.  Up until recently, I have spent most of my free time earning my Master of Science Degree in Data Science from [CUNY](https://sps.cuny.edu/academics/graduate/master-science-data-science-ms).  However, I was still able to keep a few hobbies, such as training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and watching hockey (I love to keep up with the advanced statistics).  

I grew up in Pueblo, CO where I was very active in sports and ended up being a state runner-up (Junior year) and state champion (Senior year) in wrestling.  These achievements, along with my grades, made it possible for me to attend Columbia University, which was a great opportunity even though it was quite a distance away from my home at the time.  I met my wife in college and ultimately ended up staying in the New York City area to build our lives together.  

I did not start out as a data scientist.  I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering which lead to me becoming a building energy modeler and HVAC Designer at a MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) consulting firm where I eventually earned my professional engineering license (PE).  During my time there, I taught myself how to program in VBA and Python as well as learn a monumental amount about what I was actually interested in doing.  As my career progressed, I realized just how much more I could do by using available data, and programming best practices, to become a better engineer.  I eventually changed jobs to work for a green building certification company ([GBCI](http://www.gbci.org/)).  I found myself, again, writing programs and collecting data for various tasks asked of me.  By then it was very clear what was happening.  I was trying to solve my day to day work problems with analytical and programmatic solutions. The decision to enroll and earn my Master's degree in Data Science came pretty easy at that point.  I've learned a lot along the way, but most importantly, the biggest lesson was recognizing that the path to this point in time has solidified my confidence in career choice.  

....and that brings us to present day.  I have put together some links, as well as explanations, of my work to-date in order to showcase some things I have learned along the way.  Note, some of these examples were completed fairly early in my studies or were not final projects so they may be somewhat underdeveloped, but still have some interesting aspects worth noting.

### Example Work

---  
#### Building Consumption Energy Prediction - Capstone project  
Full Report Link: [Capstone Full Report](https://github.com/john-grando/john-grando-portfolio/blob/master/CapstoneDocuments/CapstoneFullReport.pdf)  
Summary Link: [Capstone Summary Report](https://github.com/john-grando/john-grando-portfolio/blob/master/CapstoneDocuments/CapstoneSummary.pdf)  

---  
This is a comprehensive report that explores and transforms a set of survey questions about commercial building characteristics, extracts the most impactful features pertaining to electrical and natural gas consumption, and uses those features to create a deep feed-forward neural network prediction algorithm for each fuel source.  

---  
#### Shiny App  
Link: https://john-grando.shinyapps.io/data602-assignment4/  

---  
The R programming language has a package, called [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), which makes it easy to build interactive web applications.  This example allows users to enter NASDAQ stock names and view various features of the daily prices. Please note, since the creation of this project, Google has deprecated its access to historical stock prices via URL requests.  In order to keep a working example, I have manually downloaded Google's stock prices (GOOG) as a CSV file and read the file in locally.

#### New York City Energy Consumption Visualized  
Link: https://john-grando.github.io/  

---  
This project was created in an effort to showcase some programming and visualization skills I acquired.  It is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript (d3.js), and the Plotly graphing package.  While it may be somewhat inefficient and slow to present the data in this manner, the purpose was to create a solution from scratch, rather than use a third-party source (e.g. Tableau, Spotfire, etc.).

#### NHL Player Contribution vs. Salary  
Report Link: http://rpubs.com/john-grando/Data607_FinalProject  
Presentation Slide Link: http://rpubs.com/john-grando/DATA607_FinalPresentation  

---  
I have somewhat of a hobby, albeit very limited in time and scope, of tracking and evaluating NHL player data.  In this project I decided to put some of that information to the test and try to create a model that accurately predicted player salaries based on aggregated performance data from a popular website. Note, this report was prepared as part of a 'Data Acquisition and Management' course which focused on pulling, cleaning, parsing, and using data.  Therefore, there is only a limited amount of model evaluation.  Note, you can download and open this file via any web browser.

#### NHL Corsi Correction Analysis  
Link: http://rpubs.com/john-grando/Grando_Discussion12  

---  
This is a short discussion topic that attempts to show some of the correlation issues with player deployment strategies and how they effect advanced statistics used to gauge performance.

#### Housing Prices: Kaggle Competition  
Link: http://rpubs.com/john-grando/JGrando_Final  

---  
This file contains responses to a final exam for a course in Computational Mathematics, which also has a section outlining the steps taken to analyze a data set provided in a Kaggle competition.  Note, you can download and open this file via any web browser.

#### LEED Project Submittal and Certification Lifetimes  
Link: http://rpubs.com/john-grando/Grando-Project  

---  
This report is from the very first course I took in my Master's program.  While it may contain some inaccuracies due to lack of experience and knowledge, it does contain a large amount of R code that was used to analyze, visualize, and summarize a complex data set.  Note, you can download and open this file via any web browser.
